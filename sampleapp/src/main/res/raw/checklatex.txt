# ----------------------------------------------------------------
# -- Align Test --

# This latex code should create two equation (x^2 + y^2 = 1) and (y = sqrt{1 - x^2}) with align on the "=" symbol

\begin{align*} x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\ y &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \end{align*}

# Is it working?
# It seems the align command is not working!!!
# What if we change it to \aligned instead

\begin{aligned} x^2 + y^2 &= 1 \\ y &= \sqrt{1 - x^2} \end{aligned}

# OK it worked!!! need to push this fix on sanitizer
